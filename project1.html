              <p>This project was a windows application that would simulate a game store that users could buy items and
                admins could add/delete items. It would connect to a database so all info would be saved. This was the
                semesters culmination in C# and .NET applications. The project is a simple webpage that displays
                information about a project I have worked on.</p>

              <h3>Problem Solved</h3>
              <!--paragraph about how the problem i encountered was learning sql and then having to use LINQ queries to fully connect to the database-->
              <p>During the course of working on this project we were thrown into the world of LINQ 2 weeks before the end of the semester.
                This was a problem because we had to quickly learn how the queries work and how to connect them to a database.
